# Zero Trust Network Policies

This directory documents network access policies enforcing least privilege and explicit trust relationships between zones.

Policies define what traffic is permitted, denied, and monitored between segments.

---

## Policy Principles
- Default deny between zones
- Explicit allow rules based on function
- No implicit trust between network segments
- Monitoring applied to all inter-zone traffic
